| Sept 24 | 2-2:30pm |                                     In class, I explored why using binary search may not be the most efficient way to solve the problem. We also discussed putting the entire dictionary on a map, but that was getting out of hand bc the data was too long. |
| Sept 25 | 2:30-3pm |  I did a little research on hash tables, which were mentioned in class. From what I understand, hash tables are basically functions where you input a key(the word you are trying to check) and you get out a index that tells you where that word is stored. |
