| Sept 24 |  2-2:30pm  |                                                                                                                                     In class, I explored why using binary search may not be the most efficient way to solve the problem. We also discussed putting the entire dictionary on a map, but that was getting out of hand bc the data was too long. |
| Sept 25 |  2:30-3pm  |                                                                                                  I did a little research on hash tables, which were mentioned in class. From what I understand, hash tables are basically functions where you input a key(the word you are trying to check) and you get out a index that tells you where that word is stored. |
| Sept 26 | 12:45-1:45 |                                                                      In class today we talked about a couple different ideas. One was breaking up the dictionary into a map with length 26, where each index starts with its corresponding letter. Now, based on the first letter of the word, you have a smaller area where you need to do binary search on. |
|         |            |                                                                                                                              Another idea was to create a kind of tree that stores all the words in the dictionary. Each node would represent a valid word in the dictionary. To check a valid word, you would go down the tree, adding one letter at a time. |
| Sept 27 | 5:45-6:25  |                                                                                                              I was very lost so I looked more into hash tables because they are kind of intreseting. I came across one idea of multiplying each char in the string by 31(not sure why this number) in order to create a unique hash function for each letter. |
| Sept 28 |   1-1:45   |                                                                                                                                                                                Started coding: worked on setting up my classes and figuring out how to start the insert function. Talked to Mr. B about how to do this without storing a letter at each node. |
| Oct 2   |  7:15-8pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I wrote my search function for my trie. I also stared at a stupidly obvious bug with my recusive step for way too long. |
| Oct 3   | 8:40-9:10  | I put some of the functions together to make a somewhat working version of the Trie version of spellcheck. I don't understand how to combine checking if a word is not in the misspelled tree with adding it to the tree (I could re-write the function in the main class?). Also, are we supposed to traverse the misspelled tree to get the array of words? |
| Oct 3   |  tutorial  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I started my TST but got confused on how to organize and incorporate it into the rest of the classes. |
| Oct 3   |   2-3pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Oct 3   |   3-3:45   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Worked with Mr. Blick to understand how to insert using a TST. |
| Oct 4   |  12-12:30  |                                                                                                                                      I started on coding the search part of TST, I was having some issues with how to set the words to true and how to check if they are true(you have to do the check in specific places to avoid a null pointed exception). |
| Oct 4   |  12:30-1   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I finished up insert and figured out how to set words to true. |
| Oct 4   |    6-7     |                                                                                                                                                                                                 I finally figured out how to search and check for valid words. I got the small test working but I have a few extra misspelled words in the bigger test cases. |
| Oct 6   |   6-6:30   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Still struggling with figuring out how to find repeated word that are misspelled. |
| Oct 7   |  10-10:30  |                                                                                                                                                                                              I cleaned up my code a little by taking out commented out code and adding in some comments and formatting. I learned how to use a conditional for loop to debug. |
| Oct 7   |   4-4:45   |                                                                                                                                                           I continued debugging to no avail: I figured out that it was my insert that was causing the issue. I never inserted misspelled words into the tst so when I go to look for them they are not there. |
| Oct 7   |   7-7:45   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I found one small bug that solved some of the issue: I was not setting the word to true in specific scenarios of insert. |
| Oct 8   |   8-8:30   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Worked with Mr. Blick to find the bug that had to do with setting isWord to true and finalized some comments. |
